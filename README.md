Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about the Open Data Kit project and its history [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/) and read about example ODK deployments [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/deployments/).

ODK is built and deployed by a worldwide community. This repository exists to recognize all contributors to the project following the [all-contributors specification](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors).

The ODK project started in 2008 so recognizing all contributors is a work in progress! If you've contributed to ODK and your name does not appear below, you are encouraged to submit a change to .all-contributorsrc file. You can do this using just a web browser by following the [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

The .all-contributorsrc file is used to generate the contributor table below. If you would like, you can [run the all-contributors-cli tool](https://github.com/jfmengels/all-contributors-cli) to update it as part of your pull request. Don't worry if you're finding it hard to use -- project maintainers will do this periodically as well to keep the file up to date.
